## Covidcast: Forecasting Aids for DELPHI

### 1.1 Summary
### 1.2 Introduction
### 1.3 About DELPHI Research Group

The DELPHI Research Group is based at Carnegie Mellon University and is one of the two influenza forecasters in the United States. The groupâ€™s goal is to develop the theory and practice of epidemiological forecasting, with a long-term vision of making this technology as universally accepted and useful as weather forecasting is today. Prior to COVID-19, the group also worked on forecasting for influenza, dengue, and norovirus. More information on the research group can be found on its [website](https://delphi.cmu.edu/)

### 1.4 About DELPHI Covidcast 

Since March 2020, the DELPHI research group has maintained the largest public repository of real-time indicators of COVID-19 activity, publicly available through an API. Every Sunday, the DELPHI Covidcast generates forecasts of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. Every Monday, a team reviews these predictions, after which they are submitted to [COVID-19 ForecastHub](https://covid19forecasthub.org/). The forecast hub maintains up-to-date record for forecasts of COVID-19 cases, deaths and hospitalizations in the US, created by dozens of leading infectious disease modeling teams from around the globe, in coordination with the US CDC.
